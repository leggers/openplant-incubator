# Pi Incubator code!

(copied from top-level README)

The pi_incubator contains the latest code running on the Raspberry Pi in the incubators in GenSpace at time of writing (Feb 2024). They record data to an on-device SQLite database and serve the data for visualization using the [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) library to define and serve the website with only a Python installation on the device. Connectivity to the device is a choose-your-own-adventure. We use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.dev/) at Genspace.

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the [top-level README](../README.md).

## Architecture

## TODO: add a software diagram explaining the various moving parts: cronjob and systemd unit
